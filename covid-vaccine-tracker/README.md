# **COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker Dashboard**

### **Overview**

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 vaccination progress using Tableau.
It answers key questions such as:

- **What share of the population has been vaccinated?**
- **How do vaccination rates vary by country and continent?**
- **How does GDP per capita affect vaccination coverage?**

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and cleaned before visualization.
